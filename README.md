# Distributions-Through-Sampling
Assignment from Coursera

## Prompt
To complete this assignment, create a code cell that:
* Creates a number of subplots using the `pyplot subplots` or `matplotlib gridspec` functionality.
* Creates an animation, pulling between 100 and 1000 samples from each of the random variables (`x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`) for each plot and plotting this as we did in the lecture on animation.

## Code
